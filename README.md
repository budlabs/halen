# halen 

Clipboard manager inspired by [Clip**Jump**](https://clipjump.sourceforge.net/help.htm) .
Clipboard is saved while the program is running, and one can view and navigate the history
from a simple, always on top notification. Most clipboard managers display all entries in
the clipboard history at once, in a listview or menu, but with halen you view one entry
at the time, making it perfect for multiline textblocks. The navigation is handled
with ctrl+v and ctrl+c, as soon as you release the ctrl key the notification closes and
the last entry will get pasted. You can also instead of direct paste, do ctrl+x to set the 
system clipboard to the entry without pasting it. Or ctrl+d to delete a entry from the history permanently. The popup is invoked by pressing Ctrl+V+V . If you just press Ctrl+V and release ctrl key, a "normal" paste will be performed.
